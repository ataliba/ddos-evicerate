# DDOS-Evicerate

Based on [DDoS-Deflate](http://deflate.medialayer.com/) by Zaf <zaf@vsnl.com>.

### Reason for this

netstat's output has changed slightly such that the original script doesn't work anymore. Bash does wonders most of the time, but I wanted to switch to an actual programming/scripting language just to get a bit more power. Since this was being used primarily on CentOS/RHEL systems, I decided to go with Python because by default, Python comes installed to run yum.
